<H3 CLASS="western">Big changes ahead</H3>
<P>Over the last fifty years, computers have changed the world we
live in. That was <B>Part One </B>of the history of computing.<BR>The
story here is about what computers will change into and what the
consequences are likely to be. Maybe this is <B>Part Two</B>. 
</P>
<P>The phrase <A HREF="cwoc.html"><I>Computing Without Computers</I></A>
is one I started using a few years ago as a shorthand term for the
changes that are now affecting the way that we design and deliver
computing power. <I>Reconfigurable Computing</I> and <I>Custom
Computing</I> are other phrases that cover much the same ground. Its
what happens when you turn software into hardware - everything speeds
up. Though it may seem paradoxical, everything speeds up because
there is no computer around to slow down the computation.</P>
<P>Computers are all sequential, one-step-at-a-time, machines. This
is both their strength and their weakness. It is a strength because
they are flexible, standard products, easy to program and can deliver
a wide range of applications cheaply. It is a weakness because some
parts of many applications simply will not run fast enough on <I>any</I>
computer. Today&rsquo;s computers have to be surrounded by a host of
other chips which do some of this work &ndash; graphics processing,
display handling, network interfacing, sound generation, wireless
communication and others. These are all tasks that the computer could
in principle handle by itself - if it were fast enough. The trouble
is that we can&rsquo;t build computers that are nearly fast enough to
do all these tasks. So, we have grown used to a world in which
computers run applications software, and they in turn are supported
by a range of functions embedded in hardware.</P>
<P>This picture is changing. The changes are small right now, but
they are unstoppable and they herald a very different way of both
designing and delivering computer capability and the products that
require it. The changes will ultimately be massive. They will change
the structure of both the electronics and computing industry. Theys
will change the sort of products that people can buy as well as the
way that they buy and use them. They will change the way that money
is made out of delivering electronic products to customers.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">&nbsp;</H3>
<H3 CLASS="western">Why do things have to change?</H3>
<P>The technological and economic driver for these changes is simply
the nature of the silicon industry itself and the wholly
extraordinary consequences of Moore&rsquo;s Law. These forces are
moving the focus away from ASIC (application specific chip)
technology and towards standard chip products. A big winner in this
shift is reconfigurable hardware - and in particular FPGA chips. For
suitable applications, they can reduce the million dollar/six month
development cost of a new chip to a few dollars and a few days. This
is starting to have serious implications for industry.</P>
<P>The sheer size of modern FPGAs makes them costly to design for
with traditional approaches based around conventional Electronic
Design Automation (EDA) techniques. The reasons for this difficulty
include the multi-million-gate sizes now available, the shortage of
electronic design skills, the necessity to design rapidly and
reliably to meet market pressures, and the need for frequent rework
to update hardware already in service. The situation is no worse than
designing other types of chips of course, but the pity of it is that
FPGAs enable substantial reductions in the time to <I>implement</I> a
new product. This reduction really cries out for a similar reduction
in the time to <I>design</I> it as well. &nbsp;</P>
<P>The result of these pressures is inevitably on the productivity of
design engineers when working on complex systems. When I first
started working in this area in 1990, I predicted that the time was
coming when a large percentage of digital hardware would simply <I>have</I>
to be designed using software engineering - rather than hardware
engineering - methodologies. Complexity of the designed object is the
basic problem, and Moore&rsquo;s Law is doubling that complexity
every eighteen months. It seemed self-evident that the field of
software engineering had already risen to the challenge of producing
very complex systems, in relatively short timeframes, with more
easily available design skills, and moreover making large profits out
of it. So, I felt justified in expecting that the challenge of
enabling designers, who may not (or may) have hardware design skills,
to design hardware could be met also.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">What do we do about it?</H3>
<P>This is a major topic covered in the following pages. Briefly, the
major opportunity comes from compiling software directly into
hardware &ndash; and simultaneously bridging the gap that currently
exists between electronic engineering and computer programming. To
this end, I created the Handel methodology in 1990 to address the
issue of turning hardware design into a programming activity. Later,
I formed the Hardware Compilation Research Group at the University of
Oxford Computing Laboratory where the Handel-C language was
developed. The group operated until I left Oxford in 1999 when I spun
the research out as a start-up company. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">What to expect here</H3>
<P>The following pages describe how I see these changes, and
reconfigurable computing in particular, affecting industry and what
the significant opportunities are. Although the material here is in
no way a commercial advertisement, particular reference will be made
to Celoxica Ltd. the company I founded to exploit the Handel-C
language. Use the &lsquo;computing without computers&rsquo; link
