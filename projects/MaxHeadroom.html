<p class=MsoNormal>Max Headroom was an innovative 1980s television series
featuring the character Max as the presenter. Max's main feature was that he
was (supposedly) a computer-generated personality (an avatar) created from a
digitally-captured copy of a real person's brain. At the time of broadcast, and
still now, Max is something of a cult figure. In the series, Max appeared on
the screen of a box (luggable size), and real people could interact with Max by
talking to the box (fitted with microphones and speakers as well as the
television screen). There are a number of internet sites featuring Max if you
want some background (perhaps start with <a
href="http://www.techtv.com/maxheadroom/?nnav">www.techtv.com</a> or a <a
href="http://www.google.co.uk/">google</a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>keyword search).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So what has this to do with computing projects? Firstly
imagine a contemporary update of the Max Headroom concept where the box still
produces television entertainment but where the input from the real world is
not through the microphone and camera that Max had. Instead, it is simply
connected to a data feed from a massive amount of historical and current data
on the real world, namely the internet. Also rather than just creating a
particular television presenter, imagine that the box can create any type of
television programme in its entirety. Maybe also imagine that the box creates
programmes designed specifically for its particular viewer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although we obviously can't hope to achieve more than a tiny
fraction of what is implied, we might think of the ‘grand challenge' it
represents as the creation of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the ‘BBC
in a box'. So, this project, (in fact I hope it turns out to be a long series
of projects) is to build closer and closer approximations of the Max Headroom
box. Maybe one day, undoubtedly a long time from now, it might be turning out
just the television content that you want, when you want it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lest this sound too far-fetched, I believe that some of this
is possible already and completely within the scope of an undergraduate
project. For instance, consider a computer program interrogating a weather
database on the internet. The program collects suitable items from the weather
summary database (as an example the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/">BBC
weather</a> web page). It uses this data to put together a short graphical
presentation, making it as interesting, informative and entertaining as
possible. The presentation might be oriented towards a particular audience or
individual viewer by concentrating on a particular geographical area (where the
viewer lives, or where his best friend lives), or on a particular time period
(such as an upcoming holiday period), or might warn of weather conditions
affecting a particular medical condition such as asthma.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As an example of something at the other end of the spectrum
of complexity, it happens that the texts of all Shakespeare's plays are already
on the internet. A computer program that someone might one day be able to write
could perhaps take the texts, analyse them, create avatar actors and put on a
computer-generated production of King Lear that would thrill its audience.
Between the weather programme which we can do today, and the Shakespeare
production, lie many decades of development effort. Happily though, the space
between these extremes is fully populated with computer systems that can
automatically generate television programmes of continually increasing
complexity and scope. You will never want for a challenging project in the
world of Max Headroom!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I will be happy to talk to any of you that are interested in
taking on one of these projects, either individually or as a group. I have some
ideas of what might actually work as projects, but I would really like you to
create some ideas yourself. You could start by locating some interesting data
on the internet and thinking how to make an interesting visual or audio-visual
presentation from it, or you might conceive first of the presentation and then
look for resources that might help you to create it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Don't be put off by the ‘far horizon' nature of this
challenge. Personally I don't care if the project only creates one second of
visual or audio presentation, or even a single image. What is important is that
the project puts things together in a new, interesting and challenging way, and
creates something which hasn't been seen before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, what resources are available to make these projects
possible? You probably already know the computing infrastructure available to
you and I have no requirements about which programming language to use; just
use whatever makes sense, or perhaps whichever one you want to develop your programming
skills in. Graphics packages will perhaps depend on the particular project or
the programming language chosen. One additional possibility is a project which
fuses a Max Headroom challenge with the other type of project I am offering,
namely a Hardware Compilation project (see web page <a
href="HardwareCompilation.html">Hardware Compilation Projects</a>). One of the
most important benefits of Hardware Compilation is that it can be used to
create computer systems which can sustain the very high bandwidth computations
that are typical of computer graphics and video processing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are interested, please email me initially. If you
have an idea already, please include it, even if you think it is ‘off the wall'
or if you have no idea whether it is too difficult. I am experienced at running
projects like this, and together we can craft something that gives you an
interesting and challenging project but which is yet practically possible. </p>
