<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A deliberately intriguing title - but also a very real
story. The emerging story is about how the general-purpose computer is about to
lose its 50 year, unchallenged position as the only way of delivering general-purpose
computing power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The &#8216;new kid on
the block&#8217; doesn&#8217;t even have a generally accepted name yet, but we&#8217;ll call it <b>Custom
Computing</b> for now. Custom Computing is the first-born child of two other
relatively new technologies, <b>Hardware Compilation</b> and <b>Reconfigurable
Logic</b>. Together, they are set to change the way that computer systems and
everyday electronic products are designed, constructed, and delivered. Most
importantly, it will change the business model of much of the electronics and
computing industry. These changes will create massive new opportunities for
innovative companies and individuals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Reconfigurable Logic</span></b>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is a generic name for a type of silicon chip technology in
which the chip has a hardware function that can be changed at will by re-wiring
and re-programming the hardware resources on the chip before, or even during,
operation. Such chips are already hot property and are being developed at
breakneck speed. Various vendors exist and various names are used for their proprietary
technologies, such as the <b>FPGA</b> (<b>F</b>ield <b>P</b>rogrammable <b>G</b>ate
<b>A</b>rray) and the <b>CPLD</b> (<b>C</b>omplex <b>P</b>rogrammable <b>L</b>ogic
<b>D</b>evice). Here I will use the term FPGA to cover all such technologies,
because we will be little concerned with their internal architecture or market
positioning. What is important is what they can do for us &#8211; just as we can be
interested in what a computer can do for us without being concerned about
whether it&#8217;s a mainframe, a microprocessor, micro-controller or DSP. Today,
FPGAs are the fastest growing segment of the chip market &#8211; even though very few
of them are yet being used in the way that we advocate here.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The FPGA changes things radically because it gives us a way
of building hardware in a fraction of a second and at zero additional cost. This
is in stark contrast to the conventional way of building new functions into
silicon that involve designing and manufacturing an ASIC (Application Specific
Integrated Circuit). Typically, an ASIC will take many months of painstaking
work by many electronic engineers to design, and will cost a significant
fraction of $1m to build. The major benefit of an ASIC is that it is cheap to
manufacture large numbers of them &#8211; but only after you have paid the large
upfront costs for its design and the tooling for its manufacture.</p>

<h3 style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Hardware Compilation</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>is the process of turning a software program into hardware.
Today, software programs are used to deliver functionality to users and
companies like Microsoft make good business from the process. Although hardware
is also a part of electronic products, its chief component, the semiconductor
chip, is delivered using highly specialized and expensive chip fabrication
technology. The design of those chips often starts with a reference design
written in software, but today it has to be manually re-written as a
description of an electronic circuit by expensive and hard-to-find electronic
engineers. Hardware compilation aims to do away with the re-writing process,
remove the dependence on rare skills, and allow the original designer to create
the hardware personally. In this way, designing the two major components of
electronic products &#8211; hardware and software &#8211; becomes almost the same thing.
Only one type of professional is necessary to design the whole product. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With hardware compilation, a design engineer with
programming skills initially writes a computer program, in a high-level
programming language, in exactly the same way as most of today&#8217;s software is
written. Software is normally compiled &#8211; by a <i>compiler</i> program &#8211; into machine
code instructions for some particular computer. When those instructions are
subsequently loaded into the computer, it will sequentially &#8211; one at a time,
and in order &#8211; execute those instructions. The magic of computing today is that
although each of those instructions specifies only a trivial computation, we
can cheaply purchase computers that execute many millions of such instructions
every second. The result is seen in the myriad examples of computer
applications that surround us and in the structure of the industries that
deliver the products we buy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In hardware compilation by contrast, the high-level program
is instead converted into a description of a digital hardware circuit,
consisting of a connected network (i.e. a graph) of hardware components such as
logic gates, latches and RAM banks. This abstract description of the circuit
can then be made real by passing it through &#8216;Place &amp; Route&#8217; software that
turns it into a set of bits that can be loaded into an FPGA. When loaded into
the FPGA, the circuit is built in the order of a millisecond, and immediately
starts executing. Although the FPGA can undertake exactly the same computations
as a processor, the similarity ends there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the FPGA implementation, there is no microprocessor;
there is no CPU; there are no instructions; there is no operating system.
Sequential execution of simple instructions is replaced by parallel execution
of many threads of computation, each one of which may be quite complex. The
speed at which the steps of this computation proceed &#8211; the &#8216;clock rate&#8217; &#8211; will
typically be significantly less than a high-end microprocessor. However it can
perform many complex operations in each clock cycle, and it is quite common to
find that the hardware implementation can beat the fast processor by ten times
or more. Indeed it is this very speed increase that motivates us to consider
Custom Computing instead of, or as an adjunct to, regular processor-based
computing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<h3>Custom Computing <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-weight:normal'>puts
Hardware Compilation and Reconfigurable Logic together. The designer&#8217;s program
is compiled to a circuit, passed through a Place &amp; Route program, and
loaded into an FPGA where it executes; the whole process taking maybe only a
few minutes. This is a little longer than we would expect for compiling to machine
code, but maybe 10,000 times faster and cheaper than the conventional way of
turning a program into hardware.<o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<h3><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-weight:normal'>Making all this work
seamlessly and effectively so that it is completely possible for designers with
ordinary programming skills to do it is not straightforward. There are many
ways of tackling this problem that at first glance seem plausible. However many
of them are destined to failure, or at least to only partial success - which
amounts to the same thing in a competitive marketplace. In the pages here I
describe the </span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>Handel</span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-weight:normal'> strategy for hardware compilation
that I developed in 1990 and thereafter, argue why it should work, and then
refer to serious, concrete examples to demonstrate that it does indeed work. <o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<h3><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-weight:normal'>In this world, rather
than running a program on a general-purpose computer, you dynamically build a
special-purpose computer that does only the job it was designed for. With
FPGAs, the cost and speed of building, destroying, and re-building
special-purpose hardware is about the same as loading, unloading, and
re-loading programs. Thus it is a great match for conventional computing, but
with the added advantage that extremely high execution speed may be available
by using the parallel hardware approach.<o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<h3><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-weight:normal'>It may be worth pointing
out here that the general-purpose computer is - fairly obviously - a
compromise. When you are sitting at a machine evaluating a very complex
spreadsheet, you would naturally prefer that the machine was a
purpose-designed, highly efficient and fast-executing spreadsheet machine. At
the moment however you don&#8217;t get such a choice because it is economically
unviable to build and sell such special-purpose machines for spreadsheets,
databases, . Instead, we make do with a general-purpose computer that pretends
to be a spreadsheet machine by imitating its behaviour through executing a
sequential spreadsheet program.<o:p></o:p></span></h3>

<h3><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-weight:normal'>Today it is common to
write programs with no idea what type of processor the program will ultimately
run on &#8211; indeed it may run on several different ones. If we can make the High
Level Languages and the process of Hardware Compilation as seamless, it will
soon be possible to write programs so that the designer neither knows, nor
cares, whether the execution of that program is in parallel hardware,
sequential software, or some mixture of the two. Much of this development
remains to challenge and fascinate us. However, much has already been
accomplished and there is an industrial strength development route already in
use in many blue-chip companies and universities. The rest of the pages here
tell that story in more detail.</span></h3>
